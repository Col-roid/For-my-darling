<div class="section">
    <h1 class="glow">For My Darling</h1>
    <p>
    A quiet place.  
    Just for you.  
    No noise. No audience.  
    Only what I truly mean.

<div class="section">
    <h1>My Letter</h1>
    <p>
    I am not the loud kind of love.  
    Not the perfect one either.  
    Just someone who stayed, even when emotions were heavy,  
    even when silence was safer than words.  

    I don’t choose you only in the easy moments.  
    I choose you when things are calm,  
    when things are confusing,  
    and even when my mind is restless.  

    Not out of obsession.  
    But out of intention.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h1>What You Are To Me</h1>
    <p>
    Not just someone I love.  
    Not just someone I care for.  

    But the person I protect in quiet ways,  
    the one I stay gentle for,  
    and the one I return to — every single time.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h1 class="glow">Always, still choosing you.</h1>
